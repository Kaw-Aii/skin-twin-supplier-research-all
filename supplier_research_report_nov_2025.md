## 4. Strategic Recommendations

Based on the comprehensive research and analysis, the following strategic recommendations are proposed to effectively navigate the South African skincare ingredient market:

### 4.1. Re-engage with AECI Specialty Chemicals

The most significant change in the supplier landscape is the restoration of AECI's website and their full operational capacity.

While the major suppliers offer a wide range of products, it is crucial to maintain a diversified supplier base to mitigate risks and ensure a consistent supply chain.
